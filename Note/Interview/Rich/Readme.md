I prepared several questions below: 

1: Check his programming experience related to bioinformatics. 
Based on his resume, his previous work is more related to data mining (computer science). Any experience for some specific research projects related to the biology side, such as small indel detection, SV detection, repeats detection?  Genotype, or phenotype analysis.

2: Check his knowledge about containers.
Based on his conference processing paper "Resolving pipeline installation conflicts with containerization", tell us the differences between  singularity and docker. 

3: Check his knowledge about HPC running environment
There are three typical ways to use HPC running environment:
-   (1) module file
-   (2) container (sandbox) -> singularity
-   (3) conda
If people want to start a project or pipeline & some third-party tools need to be used, may I know your suggestions about which strategy should be used in a cluster?

4: Check his knowledge about building sequence pipeline 
The difference (can not be reused) and the similar parts (can be reused) between humane genome analysis and microbial genome analysis.  

5:  Check his experience about snakemake & automation pipeline 
- (1) For snakemake, which design of snakemake is good (you think), and which part you think can still be improved?
- (2) Without snakemake, how do you implement the automation for a big pipeline in a cluster?

6: Check how his knowledge about the quality of pipeline 
- (1) How do you make the pipeline be reproducible.
- (2) How do you write the testing case & unit testing & regression testing.
- (3) Documentation: which tools are you using? 

7: Check his  research 
- (1) Based on his paper: Large-scale curation of human microbiome datasets for machine learning
   - a) How do you use ML in this topic
   - b) which ML model were you using? Other traditional models? ML VS DL?
- (2) Based on his paper: Comparing quality of reporting between preprints and peer-reviewed articles in the biomedical literature.
   - a) Talk something more about "quality of reporting".

Due to the time limitation, I only asked questions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7.1.
