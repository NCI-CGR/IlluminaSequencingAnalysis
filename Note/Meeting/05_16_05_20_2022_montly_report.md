Major works has been done: 
1: RNA pipeline 
   1) Transferred the RNA pipline Cron job to Chad.
   2) Guaid Chad how to deploy the code in cluster, handle some specific cases (e.g. unfinished jobs), adding new functions into the pipeline, organize testing data and debug the error. 
      i) Write some docs in github 
   3) Help chad a new functions into RNA pipeline 
   4) Help Chad know something about UMI and compile fgbio source for him.
      i) Run some part of code in biowulf. Help chad write code to run the code in biowulf parallelly. 

2: SV pipeline 
  1) Tried some tools for preprocess raw data and qualtiy control based on pacbio HIFI reads 
     a) NanoPlot
	   i) reads length distribution 
	  ii) reads quality
	 b) filtlong
	   i) Filter some low quality reads before mapping 
	    
     summarize 
	 1: Solved some bugs from these software 
	 2: one works good another did not work fine 
	    a) Nanoplot is good to be used 
		   some nice plot chart 
		b) filter long is not good 
		   filterred many reads
		   20G -> 1G reads 
		   1) Use the default settings 
		   2) Just did some basic investigation (some parameter is realted to how wet lab generate these reads) Did not investigate it more 
		   
		   
   2) Build the artitact of the whole pipeline 
      1) Data structure normalization
         Right now, we do not have the fixed data format. 
         convert these different style of data structure to the standard folder structure. 
		 
      2) pre-quality control 
	  3) alignment 
	  4) call sv 
	  5) get consensus sv callset
	  6) post quality control 
	  
   3) Regarding get consensus sv callset 
	  1) Read paper 
	     try machine learning and voting to compare the performance
	  2) Implementation
	     1) Try to reuse the code from paper -> hard to be used, pop up some error and not flexible
		 2) Implement the code by myself, both 
		    1) machine learning
			2) voting 
	
	  3) Many discussion with pacbio stuff about how to get the metrics defined in CVF file 
 
 Partially
