## Discussion
Hi all,

1) Need to start addressing the WGS data that has been generated to date, 

2) review QC metrics for what we have been able to analyze on Biowulf/CCAD for some, and reconcile files received with samples sent.


3) Weâ€™ll follow up this first meeting with a larger one that will start to address data that is currently received and stored on GCP

4) Discuss potential use of Nvidia/parabricks for analysis, 

5) eventually loop in others to discuss the larger analytical plan post variant calling (including potential use for informing/improving imputation for some of our Hispanic GWAS efforts.
