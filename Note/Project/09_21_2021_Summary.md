# Project Summarization
1. Total ** pipelines
   * exclude some small tools I developed for some old spesific requirements
      * We do not need to spend time to maintain them

2. Three categories, inlcuding

 - (1) Illumina short reads (DNA & RNA) -> 3
   * Primary pipeline
   * Prepare Untrimmed Reads
   * COVID project (include both primary and 2nd pipeline)
   
 - (2) Pacbio long reads (HiFi reads) -> 1
   * structure variation detection for whole genome sequencing

 - (3) 

## Illumina short reads (DNA & RNA)
## 1: Primary pipeline
1. Track new flowcells
2. Debug the running error
3. Fix bugs
   * e.g. sending warning email when something bad occured in cluster

## 2:
