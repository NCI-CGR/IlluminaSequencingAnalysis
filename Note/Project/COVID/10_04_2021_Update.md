### Good News
I have good news for our COVID project: the COVID-Auto-Framework runs amazingly good (even exceed my expectation): every step is finished perfectly so far, including 
1) RetrieveBAM
2) BuildManifest
3) MergeSubject
4) ReconstructBAMDir
5) RecalibrateBAM
6) ConstructBAMRecalibreatePerManifest
7) CoverageReport
8) CoverageReportSummary
 
Right now, the PreCallingQCReport is running, and the step of "BAM contamination check" will be executed after that. I will keep checking it and update the team channel on time.
 
In the meantime, may I know if Kristie Jones, Kristine (NIH/NCI) [C] could help us to check if the coverage report looks good? Please check the link below:

Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
Best
Xin
