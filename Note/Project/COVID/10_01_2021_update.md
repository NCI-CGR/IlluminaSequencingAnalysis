## 10-01-2021 update

Generall speaking, all of core parts for the whole "COVID project" have been implemented basically. 

The upstream analysis pipeline for COVID project can be run automaically by using cronjob. 

So far, 50 subjects from low-input keytable (50%) have been retrieved from S3 back to Biowulf. 

10 of them are processing by using our COVID automation pipeline. 

We plan to check the running results for these 10 subject first and will process the rest subjects if everything looks OK. 

I will use 2 section to let people know what has been finished so far basically based in different perspective. 

Since this is a relatively big pipeline, which contains a lot of different parts, I plan to spend additional time next week (several days) to do the better documentation. 

### The Perspective from Regular User
1. Finished a tool to retrive bam from S3 to biowulf based on giving keytable
2. Finished the automation framework to do everything by only click "one button" (one line command line)
3. Finished a brand new automation pipeline for bam contamination check
4. Transplanted the essential code of existing 2nd pipeline from CCAD to Biowulf for COVID project specifically 
5. Build small size testing dataset (two), and do the basic testing  
6. Reteive real data from S3 to biowulf 
7. deply corntab job in biowulf and run the real data partially
